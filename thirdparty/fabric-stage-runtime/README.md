# fabric-stage-runtime

Special thanks to the origin of this project: https://github.com/Immersive-Data-Center-Management/idtx-flow.

An OpenUSD runtime shipped as an Elixir/Hex package for ports, adapters and Elixir consumers.

To build from source set `OPENUSD_BUILD=true` before `mix compile` to build OpenUSD locally.

## Usage

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:stage_runtime, "~> 0.1.0-dev"}]
end
```

```elixir
StageRuntime.include_dir()  #=> ".../openusd-26.05-<triplet>/include"
StageRuntime.lib_dir()      #=> ".../openusd-26.05-<triplet>/lib"  (contains usd_ms)
StageRuntime.target()       #=> "x86_64-linux-gnu" | "aarch64-apple-darwin" | "x86_64-windows-msvc"
```
