SCons tool: godot_scn_writers

Wires the slangc-lowered Godot .scn writer outputs into libidtx_core.

The Lean spec at openusd-fabric/lean/Fabric/Serialization/GodotScn.lean
defines a `bake_scn_kernel` compute entry that calls every writer
helper, so slangc keeps the whole library alive through dead-code
elimination. The lowered targets are committed at:

  flow/core/share/godot_scn/godot_scn.cpp   (host-callable C++, 779 lines)
  flow/core/share/godot_scn/godot_scn.metal (Metal kernel, 739 lines)
  flow/core/share/godot_scn/godot_scn.spv   (SPIR-V binary, ~8 KB)
  flow/core/share/godot_scn/godot_scn.spv.txt  (SPIR-V assembly, audit form)

Why three targets and not just CPU:
  CPU   — works HEADLESS. No GPU required. Every CI runner regardless
          of hardware can compile and execute the .cpp. This is also
          what libidtx_core links into the host binary for actual .scn
          writing today.
  Metal — exercises the macOS CI/CD path on Apple Silicon GitHub
          Actions runners. Compiles via `xcrun -sdk macosx metal`.
          Validates that the kernel survives Apple's GPU lowering.
  SPIR-V — normal GPU execution on Windows / Linux via Vulkan, AND
          runs on Mac CI through MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal translation).
          So Mac CI validates both Metal and Vulkan paths; Linux/Win
          CI validates SPIR-V directly. Three independent lowerings ⇒
          three sanity checks on the Lean spec's well-formedness.

Neither `lake` nor `slangc` needs to be on PATH at build time — the
outputs are in git. A future CI job (TODO) re-runs the pipeline and
diffs against what's committed to catch drift.

SCons wiring:
- Adds flow/core/share/godot_scn/godot_scn.cpp to the libidtx_core source
  list so it compiles into both the shared lib and the static archive.
- Defines IDTX_GODOT_SCN_AVAILABLE so idtx_export_scn.cpp delegates
  to the slangc-emitted bake_scn_kernel.
- Adds the slang prelude include dir (resolved via the `slangc`
  binary's neighbouring `include/` directory) to CPPPATH so
  `<slang-cpp-prelude.h>` resolves at compile time. If slangc is not
  found, falls back to expecting the prelude on the system include
  path — common when slang was installed via package manager.
