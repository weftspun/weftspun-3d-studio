- Real-time design preview

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Core3D Service** (`src/services/core3dService.js`)
   - Handles all API communications with Core3D
   - Manages authentication and request formatting
   - Provides error handling and event system

2. **Core3D Context** (`src/context/Core3DContext.jsx`)
   - React context for state management
   - Provides hooks for component access
   - Manages loading states and error handling

3. **Core3D Panel** (`src/components/Core3DPanel.jsx`)
   - Main UI component with tabbed interface
   - Coordinates all Core3D functionality
   - Provides status indicators and error handling

### Feature Components

4. **Setup Component** (`src/components/Core3DSetup.jsx`)
   - API key configuration
   - Connection testing
   - Feature overview and help

5. **Models Component** (`src/components/Core3DModels.jsx`)
   - Browse and search 3D models
   - Upload custom models
   - Model selection and preview

6. **Materials Component** (`src/components/Core3DMaterials.jsx`)
   - Browse and search materials/textures
   - Upload custom materials
   - Material selection and preview

7. **Designer Component** (`src/components/Core3DDesigner.jsx`)
   - AI-powered design generation
   - Model and material combination
   - Design options and preview

8. **Exports Component** (`src/components/Core3DExports.jsx`)
   - Export generated designs
   - Multiple format support
   - Quality and customization options

- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

### Export System
- Core3D designs can be exported in multiple formats
- Integration with existing GLB/VRM export functionality
- Quality settings and optimization options

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. **Setup**: Configure your Core3D API key in the Setup tab
2. **Models**: Browse and select 3D models from the library
3. **Materials**: Choose textures and materials for your design
4. **Design**: Use the AI designer to generate combinations
5. **Export**: Export your designs in various formats

### API Key Configuration
1. Get your API key from the [Core3D Dashboard](https://www.core3d.io/dashboard)
2. Enter the key in the Setup tab
3. Test the connection to verify access
4. Start using Core3D features

### Design Generation
1. Select a model from the Models tab
2. Choose a material from the Materials tab
3. Configure design options (quality, lighting, etc.)
4. Generate the design using AI
5. Preview and export the result
