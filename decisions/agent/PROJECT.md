# Project, Weftspun3DStudio. Cap: 80 lines.

## Architecture
- Vite React app. Three.js viewport. Tasks POST to 3DAIGC-API and poll jobs.
- `src/library/taskManager.js` owns HTTP job lifecycle. `aiModelsCatalog.js` mirrors API models.
- Avatar/VRM path: trait assembly + export. AIGC mesh→rig results follow API avatar rig contract.
- XR: WebXR in-browser. IWSDK lab on `/xr`. Galaxy XR face relay is separate from `/xr` voice proxy.
- Desktop builds via Electron (`dist-win` / `dist-mac` / `dist-linux`).

## Constraints & non-goals
- Public Vercel demo must not ship LAN/DGX secrets (`verify:public-env`).
- Default: Surface runs UI. DGX runs API, do not flip without user intent.
- Sync ownership: PC owns `src/` + monetization roadmap push. DGX-owned Pitch Deck/README pull via sync scripts.
- Weftspun Host is a separate native app, Weftspun may spawn it later (phase 2).

## Glossary
- **Task**, one generation job in the UI backed by an API feature/model.
- **Environment scan**, walk video → LingBot-Map world package (API `environment_scan`).
- **Template rig**, API Blender path applying template.vrm to AIGC mesh.
- **MSF**, fabric hosted on DGX MSF `:8443`. Surface often proxies `:8453`.

## Landmines
- Wrong Surface path (`Weftspun3DStudio\CharacterStudio`) → real clone is often `Documents\GitHub\CharacterStudio`.
- Nested `docs/docs/docs` from bad scp → prune. Use selective doc sync.
- Mixing VRM upload loader vs template-rig GLB orientation → see API_AVATAR_RIG_CONTRACT / aigcRigContract.
- Pointing headset at `localhost` hits the headset, not Surface Vite.
