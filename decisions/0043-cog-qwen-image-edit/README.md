# RFD 0043: Cog for qwen_q4_k_m_image_edit

**State:** discussion
**Feature:** model packaging

## Problem

Qwen image edit is the largest model in the catalog at 27.0 B
parameters. In bf16 it needs 54.0 GB, which is 46 percent of the whole
catalog on its own.

The model id already names the format. It ships Q4_K_M, and the
catalog entry records that choice in its name.

## Decision

Ship Q4_K_M only. Never build a bf16 variant of this Cog.

At 0.55 bytes per parameter it needs 14.85 GB, and not 54.0 GB. That
one choice saves 39.15 GB, which RFD 0027 records as the largest
single saving in the catalog.

## The model

| Property   | Value                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------- |
| Parameters | 27.0 B, published         |
| bf16       | 54.0 GB, never built      |
| Q4_K_M     | 14.85 GB, the ship format |
| License    | Apache 2.0                |

The count covers the edit backbone and the vision language encoder
that reads the instruction. The encoder is not optional, because the
instruction is text and the edit is spatial.

## The interface

| Input       | Type  | Default |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| image       | Path  | none    |
| instruction | str   | none    |
| strength    | float | 0.8     |
| steps       | int   | 20      |
| seed        | int   | -1      |

`instruction` is a sentence, and not a tag list. "Make the jacket red"
works. "jacket, red" does not, because the encoder reads language.

## The quality question stays open

No measurement compares Q4_K_M against bf16 for this model. The saving
is certain, and the quality cost is not.

Measure before the catalog depends on it. Run 20 edits in each format,
and compare them by eye. RFD 0027 permits both formats, thus a bf16
build stays legal if the measurement demands it.

row. RFD 0028 clears Apache 2.0.
