/**
 * @file ExtensionBootstrap.cpp
 * @brief Bootstrap implementation for IDTXFlow dependent GDExtensions.
 *
 * This file is compiled into a static library (libidtxflow_ext_bootstrap)
 * that every IDTXFlow-dependent extension links against. It provides:
 *
 *   1. The platform-specific DLL/SO resolution glue (delay-load hook on
 *      Windows, dlsym validation on POSIX).
 *   2. The idtxflow_ext_bootstrap_init() function called by the
 *      IDTXFLOW_EXTENSION_ENTRY_POINT macro before Godot binding init.
 *
 * Because this is a static library that gets linked into each extension's
 * shared library, each extension gets its own copy of the hook — which is
 * exactly what the MSVC delay-load mechanism requires (the hook symbol
 * __pfnDliNotifyHook2 must be in the same image that uses /DELAYLOAD).
