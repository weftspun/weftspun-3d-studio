/**
 * @file DlResolve_posix.h
 * @brief POSIX runtime validation that IDTXFlow symbols are resolvable.
 *
 * On Linux and macOS, Godot loads the IDTXFlow shared library before dependent
 * extensions initialize (via the .gdextension [dependencies] section). Unlike
 * Windows, there is no delay-load mechanism — the dynamic linker resolves
 * symbols at load time via RPATH/RUNPATH.
 *
 * This helper performs a lightweight runtime check using dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)
 * to confirm that key IDTXFlow symbols are actually available in the process.
 * If they are not, it prints a clear diagnostic message.
 *
 * DO NOT include this header directly — it is pulled in by ExtensionBootstrap.cpp.
